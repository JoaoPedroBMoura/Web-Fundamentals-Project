# Web-Fundamentals-Project
Project built at my college to learn web development skills

The project makes use of a local library, in the fonts directory, communicating with the fonts.css file

It's a base project. A simple website, some CSS styles and the main HTML tags.

There is no need to make other imports, downloading the complete file and opening the index file in the browser will already show the final website.
